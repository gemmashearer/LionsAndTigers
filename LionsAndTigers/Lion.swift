// created a new class Lion along with the additional properties with default values

class Lion {
    var age = 0
    var isAlphaMale = false
    var image = UIImage(named: "")
    var name = ""
    var subspecies = ""
}

//would have been better to create a class for both lions and tigers and have each one of them as a subclass
